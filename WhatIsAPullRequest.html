  <h1>What is a pull request?</h1>

<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>A "pull request" is a request for merging new polished code from a lower branch into the parent branch.</p>
<p>Normally the parent branch is beeing monitor and maintained by a "project maintainer". With a pull request we prompt the maintainer to pull our code into the project branch.</p>
<p>A pull request can be approved or rejected. To be approved, generally, the code goes to a review, which can include a automated tests.</p>

    <h2>Advantages</h2>
<p>Pull request enhable your team to check each other work before the code is pushed to the development branch or even the master branch.</p>
<p>On top of that, pull request can be reverted, so that code that was added can be removed safely in a few simple steps. This is a great functionality that cannot be achieved with simple push comands!</p>

    <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
<p>It is a lot of bureocracy, and it require time. </p>
<p>Ultimatelly, it depends on the type of project you are working on if this is a good trade-off</p>
<p>Generally, enterprise projects, and collaborations demand this practice.</p>
