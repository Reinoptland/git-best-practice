    <h1>The first thing you should know!</h1>
    <p>You should not push to master</p>
    <p>For these reasons:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Master branch is probably continuously deployed, if we push straight to
        master we are prone to get bugs in our final version.
      </li>
      <li>Your code will not be reviewed</li>
      <li>You can not easily undo the changes</li>
      <li>Nobody will know exactly what you changed</li>
      <li>Your colleagues will just have to pray you didn't break anything.</li>
      <li>If your code created bugs, some users will have a bad experience.</li>
      <li>Your employer will look like the image below</li>
    </ol>
